{b}Deep Resonance Manual

This mod is in beta! Currently it does not have any way to make your own
crystals. You can however generate power with naturally spawned crystals.

{b}Resonating Ore
{n:ore}
Deep under the ground a good miner can occasionally find resonating
ore. If you do then this can be your start to a big adventure.

Note that this version of Deep Resonance is not ready yet. For now
this ore can only be used as a crafting ingredients for the
generator machines in this mod.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Resonating Crystals
{n:crystals}
Very rarely you can find a resonating crystal in a deep cave. Collect these
crystals. These crystals have low power and low purity but they can
be useful for early game power. Just place them near a correctly
formed generator.

Note that crystals explode heavily if there is a nearby explosion (like
from a creeper). Be careful! The power of this explosion depends on the
power that is in the crystal as well as the strength of this crystal.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Crystal Attributes
{n:attributes}
Every crystal has four basic characteristics:

    * Strength: this is the inherent strength of a crystal. The stronger
      a crystal is the more power it can contain. This goes from 0% to
      100% but in the future you will be able to 'overcharge' crystals
      for even more power (and even more danger).
    * Efficiency: this represents how efficient this crystal is at
      producing power. i.e. a higher efficiency means a higher RF/tick.
    * Purity: this represents how clean the crystal is. Low purity crystals
      will cause more radiation and are less efficient at producing power.
    * Power: this is the actual power that is still left in this crystal.
      It is represented as a percentage of the total possible power that
      this crystal has.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Radiation
{n:radiation}
A running generator will produce radiation. The amount of radiation
as well as the power of this radiation depends on the power of the
crystal as well as the purity of it. A 100% pure crystal that is not
overcharged will generate no radiation.

Naturally spawned crystals are not pure but because they contain
little power they don't cause a lot of radiation. So you can use
them for early game power.

Turning off a generator will not immediatelly stop the radiation.
Depending on the strength of the radiation it will take a while before
it completely disappears.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Radiation Monitor
Using the radiation monitor you can measure how much radiation there
is in a certain area:
{ri:radiationMonitorItem}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Machine Frame
{n:frame}
Nearly everything in this mod requires a machine frame as a basic
crafting ingredient:
{rb:machineFrame}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Generator Block
{n:generator}
To generate power you need a generator multiblock. The basis of this block
is the generator which you craft as follows:
{rb:generatorBlock}

A single block supports up to 2 crystals and maximum 10KRF/tick. If you
need to handle more or more powerful crystals you will have to add blocks
to your generator. A generator can be any shape. It doesn't have to be
rectangular.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Energy Collector
{n:collector}
The generator on its own cannot get the power out of the crystals. For that
you need one energy collector on top of the generator multiblock. Only
one collector can be put on a single generator multiblock. You can make
this collector as follows:
{rb:energyCollectorBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Generator Controller
{n:controller}
The generator can only work if it is turned on. You can do that with
the generator controller:
{rb:generatorControllerBlock}

To turn on the generator simply give this block a redstone signal.
